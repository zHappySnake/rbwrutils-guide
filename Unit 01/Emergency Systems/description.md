# Emergency Systems

These systems can keep the reactor stable even when the Main Cooling Circuit is unusable, however enabling either the LPCI or RCIC will immediately trip the reactor.

### Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI):
Quickly pumps water into the reactor, but it requires the pressure to be below 3000 kPa and the safety bus to be powered in order to function.

### Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC):
A completely steam-driven feedwater pump that takes time to start or stop. It also has a relief valve that acts like an extra bypass.

### Steam Relief Valve:
Vents out steam from the cooling circuit, which rapidly lowers pressure. Due to the steam being lost, it also lowers the overall amount of water in the system.

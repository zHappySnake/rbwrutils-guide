# Alarms

There are several different types of alarms, ranging in severity. Lots of alarms, such as low/high IPR, can be safely ignored. Most alarms can be ignored during a shutdown.

All alarms are displayed in a grid on a separate panel above their respective panels. Red alarms are the most important, but all alarms exist for a reason. They also have distinct sounds.

### Acknowledge (Ack.)
Silences all current alarms on the panel and turns them off if the problem is resolved. It also stops them from blinking.

### Silence (Sil.)
Silences all current alarms on the panel. The master silence on the reactor control panel silences all of them at once.

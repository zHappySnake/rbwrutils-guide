# Main Cooling Circuit (MCC)

**MCC** (Main Cooling Circuit) is responsible for the distribution of the water in the main water circuit. There are 3 main spots for the water to go;
\- Hotwell
\- Deaerator
\- Reactor

The water flows in this order:
Hotwell -----> Deaerator -----> Reactor -----> Hotwell

There are 4 pumps which pump water from 1 spot to the other.
Condenser pumps ( x2 ) - Pumps water from the hotwell to the deaerator
FWP (Feedwater pumps) ( x2 )- Pumps water from the deaerator to the reactor
